        <p class="txt indie">The question of how to price services is age-old. Web designers and developers generally charge by the project or by the hour, or use some combination of the two. I believe that whenever possible, you should charge based on the value you deliver to your clients. That value is based more on your skills, experience, and the finished product than the time you spent. Here's a brief story to illustrate my point.
  
  Picasso was in a park when a woman asked him to draw her portrait. Picasso agreed and quickly sketched her. When he handed her the sketch, she was pleased and asked how much she owed to him. Picasso replied, "$5,000." The woman screamed, “But it took you only five minutes!” Picasso replied, "No, madam, it took me my entire life."
  
  Picasso didn't charge for the five minutes, but for the value of the sketch, which represented his skills and the experience he gained over his lifetime.</p>
